>*Please Note: <br>Since this repository is not about re-learning someone else's courseware,
>I consider the theoretical course material to be IBM and Coursera's own,
>so I will post the practical exercises in this repository, complete with my own analysis, visualization and solution code* ***to help those who get stuck writing a code, have no one to ask and therefore cannot move forward, because from my own experience it can be time consuming to figure out the key to a solution.***  

&#9733; Enjoy Coding! &#9733;<br>
