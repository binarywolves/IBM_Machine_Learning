## Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender Systems:

-  ### A) Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender System using K Nearest Neighbor:
   -  PART1_Collaborative_Filtering_Based_Recommender_System_using_K_Nearest_Neighbor.ipynb
      
      → Implementation Option 1: Use `Surprise` library
      
      
   -  PART2_Collaborative_Filtering_Based_Recommender_System_using_K_Nearest_Neighbor.ipynb
      
      → Implementation Option 2: Use `numpy`, `pandas`, and `sklearn`
      <br><br>

-  ### B) Collaborative Filtering based Recommender System using Non-negative Matrix Factorization
