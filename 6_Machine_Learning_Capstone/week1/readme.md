# Intro

>*The first week was an introduction and some basics. <br>Since this repository is not about re-learning someone else's courseware,
>I consider the theoretical course material to be IBM and Coursera's own,
>so I will post the practical exercises in this repository, complete with my own analysis, visualization and solution code.*
